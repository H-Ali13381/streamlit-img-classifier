# Image Classifier WebApp

## Overview
This project is a web application for classifying images, built using **Streamlit**. The app enables users to upload an image and get predictions based on a pre-trained machine learning model. (ResNet50 CNN)

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Drag and drop or browse to upload images.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Classify uploaded images near instantly.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Built with Streamlit for an intuitive experience.

## Usage
1. Open the app in your browser (https://app-img-classifier.streamlit.app/).
2. Upload an image using the provided upload button. (see TestImages for examples)
3. View the classification results displayed on the screen.
